# Datasheet

## Motivation

This dataset seems to have been created as a learning tool. Though no clear indication as to the authors original intent.

 
## Composition

- Each instances represents a labelled image of a monkey of one of ten species.
- There are approximately 1400 images in the dataset (Details of the breakdown are available in the monkey_labels.txt file included with the dataset)
- There doesn't appear to be any missing data, and all of the classes have roughly the same quantity of images
- There is no data included that could be considered confidential

## Collection process

- The data is scrapped from a google image search for each of the listed species of monkey
- As this is a list of google results the dataset could technically be extended, but this dataset has not been sampled in any random way from a larger set.
- This data was gathered in a single instance in 2017, and was updated once in 2018.

## Preprocessing/cleaning/labelling

- No pre-processing or additional labelling was carried out on this dataset
 
## Uses

- This dataset is only useful in image classification tasks, it may useful for both broad and fine-grained classification tasks. This will depend on the granularity of classification required.
- There is no sensitive data associated with the dataset, so there are no immediately obvious reasons to restrict its use.

## Distribution

- This dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/slothkong/10-monkey-species/data), and is published under the Public Domain.

## Maintenance

- There is no regular maintenance of this dataset
